--What is the RANK() function?
---The RANK() function is like giving medals in a race.
---It gives each person (or row of data) a position based on their score: 1st, 2nd, or 3rd place, etc

--Why do we use RANK()?
---We use it when we want to see who did the best, second-best, third-best, and so on.
---It helps us know who is at the top 
---                 who is in the middle 
---                 who is at the bottom 
---based on some numbers/date (like scores, sales, dates or times).

--When should you use RANK()?
---Use RANK() when you want to compare things and order them
---by how big or small their values are. 
----For example:
------Who {sold} the most {books}?     replace sold=found, bought, ate, sold, borrowed, drank, raised, ran, travelled
------  								replace books=cars, CD's, hotdogs, money, gold, laps, miles

--How do you use Rank()
---You pick the thing you want to rank (like {sales}).
---Use the RANK() function and tell it how to order the data (biggest to smallest or smallest to biggest).
---It gives each person or row a number based on their position.

--PARTITION BY = It doesnâ€™t reduce the rows. 
--Instead, it splits the data into sections (or partitions) 
--for things like ranking or calculations. 

--It keeps all the rows, but it calculates things separately for each section.
